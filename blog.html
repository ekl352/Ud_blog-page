                        One of the most important parts of helping a dog with Seperation Anxiety is patience. It can be very hard in the beginning, but making a plan and patiently seeing it through (in the months to come) will be your biggest path to success.

            <h2 id="hd2">To start, it's best if you can get the tools that you need:</h2>

                <ul>
            	      <li>Rewards for your dog (whether that be treats, toys, or cuddles!)</li>
            	      <li>A camera. Think baby camera, or game cam, You can buy cheap ones from amazon <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZIJPNY" id="blue">here</a>. You don't need anything fancy. </li>
            	      <li>A dog crate</li>
            	  </ul>

            	  <p>
                    Now you will want to start the training. Don't make a big deal about leaving. Many folks will love on their dog right before going- but this will just set off the stress reaction for your dog. It's best to not make a big commotion out of it. Grab your keys, put on your shoes like you are going out, and exit the home. Just before you leave, give your dog something they like that will keep their mind active. For my pup, I sprinkle a few of her favorite treats in her snuffle mat so she is distracted by that.
                </p>

            	  <p>
                    When you are far enough away that your dog think's you're gone (maybe drive your car down the block- or just walk a block down) Take a look at the camera. As soon as your dog shows signs of anxiety return home and repeat. The goal is to work up to 30 minutes without your dog getting anxious. Eventually, you can work your way up to four hours apart!
