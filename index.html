            <h2 id="sub-heading">Our Story</h2>
            <p id="p1">When I got my <b>first</b> dog from the local animal shelter, I was extremely excited to finally have a canine companion of my own. After spending several years travelling and bouncing from seasonal job to seasonal job, I was really looking for something to help me feel more grounded. I'd always been surrounded by dogs growing up, and I knew that this was what I wanted.</p>

            <p id="p2">Then I met <u>Leila</u>. Her need for a constant companion had me quickly falling in love with her. When I would go into her kennel, as an animal care technician at the time, to let her out, she would immediately jump on me to say hello. We'd go outside, and if I tried to head back in to clean, she would jump on me again, this time wrapping her front two paws around me, in an embrace (and a plea to stay). I knew then and there I'd need to take her home.</p>

            <p id="p3">After a few days of fostering (to make sure my roommates animal's would accept this misfit into our home), I made it official and <em>adopted my first dog!</em> A 6 year old Siberian Husky mix (who I didn't really know even those details about as she was found as a stray in a home depot). I knew it wouldn't be an easy road- as she was already adopted and returned one time, for getting out constantly. Her old owner told us she knew how to open windows- I figured he was exaggerating- but I soon learned that was just a small bit of her many skills.</p>

            <p id="p4">One of the first times I left her alone was to walk to a local brewery with my roommates. We made sure the windows and doors were securely shut before walking a few blocks down. We had just about made it to the Brewery when I saw Leila running down the road after us. It was like she was saying, 'hey guys! you forgot me!</p>
