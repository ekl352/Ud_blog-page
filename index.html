                    <p id="p1">
                        When I first met <b>Leila</b>, it was when I worked at the local humane society as an animal care techinician.  When I would enter her kennel to let her out, she would immediately jump on me to say hello. We'd go outside, and if I tried to head back in to clean, she would jump on me again, this time wrapping her front two paws around me, in an embrace (and a plea to stay). I knew then and there I'd need to take her home. What I didn't know was that these were early signs of her severe seperation anxiety.
                    </p>

                    <p id="p2">
                        Leila was estimated to be a <u> 6 year old Siberian Husky mix </u> (she was found as a stray in a Home Depot parking lot). I knew adopting her wouldn't be an easy road; she'd already been adopted and returned one time for getting out constantly. Her prior owner told us she even knew how to open windows, though I figured he was exaggerating.  However, I soon learned that that was just a small sample of her many skills.
